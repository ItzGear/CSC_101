# Step 1: Assign values to variables
base = 10  # length of the base in cm
height = 4  # height of the triangle in cm

# Step 2: Calculate area
area = (1/2) * base * height

# Step 3: Display result
print("The area of the triangle is:", area, "cmÂ²")

# Step 1: Define variables
garden_length = 50  # in cm
garden_width = 80   # in cm
fence_length = 15   # in cm

# Step 2: Calculate garden perimeter
garden_perimeter = 2 * (garden_length + garden_width)

# Step 3: Calculate number of fences needed
number_of_fences = -(-garden_perimeter // fence_length)  # Using ceiling division

# Step 4: Print final result
print(f"Number of fences needed: {number_of_fences}")

# Step 1: Define total amount in cents
total_cents = 835

# Step 2: Calculate number of dollars
dollars = total_cents // 100

# Step 3: Calculate remaining cents after extracting dollars
remaining_after_dollars = total_cents % 100

# Step 4: Calculate number of dimes
dimes = remaining_after_dollars // 10

# Step 5: Calculate remaining cents after extracting dimes
remaining_after_dimes = remaining_after_dollars % 10

# Step 6: Calculate number of quarters
quarters = remaining_after_dimes // 25

# Output results
